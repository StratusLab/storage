This module adds support for NetApp filers and LVM as a pdisk storage backend.

Support is implemented through the script
scripts/persistent-disk-netapp.py. This script handles all pdisk
operations (create, delete, rebase, snapshot). The action to execute
is selected with option --action. Use option --help to get the full
list of supported options.

In addition to options, the script requires up to 3 arguments
depending on the action. See --help for details.

Note : as of writing, pdisk uses this scipt only for managing NetApp
backends.

+ Configuration +
+++++++++++++++++

This script requires a configuration file to describe which filers are
available, how to connect them, where to create new LUNs...  The
default config file is
/etc/stratuslab/pdisk-backend.cfg. This location can be
modified with option --config.  This script is divided into sections
introduced by '[section_name]'. Section [main] is required and must
list the available iSCSI proxies (servers) in iscsi_proxies
attribute. For each iSCSI proxy, a section is required whose name must
be the proxy name. This section lists parameters specific to the iSCSI
proxy.

A typical configuration file for a NetApp back-end looks like:
------------------------------------------
[main]
log_file =
iscsi_proxies=nfsserv21,nfsserv22
mgt_user_name=root
mgt_user_private_key=/some/dir/key.rsa

# First filer
[nfsserv21]
# iSCSI back-end type (case insensitive)
type=NetApp
# Initiator group the LUN must be mapped to
initiator_group = linux_servers
# Name appended to the volume name to build the LUN path (a / will be appended)
lun_namespace=stratuslab
# Volume name where LUNs will be created
volume_name = /vol/iscsi
# Name prefix to use to build the volume snapshot used as a LUN clone snapshot parent
# (a _ will be appended)
volume_snapshot_prefix=pdisk_clone

# Second filer : values can be identical or different to previous server
# depending on site actual configuration choices
[nfsserv22]
# iSCSI back-end type (case insensitive)
type=NetApp
# Initiator group the LUN must be mapped to
initiator_group = linux_servers
# Name appended to the volume name to build the LUN path (a / will be appended)
lun_namespace=stratuslab
# Volume name where LUNs will be created
volume_name = /vol/iscsi2
# Name prefix to use to build the volume snapshot used as a LUN clone snapshot parent
# (a _ will be appended)
volume_snapshot_prefix=pdisk_clone
------------------------------------------

For a LVM back-end, a typical configuration file would be:
------------------------------------------
[main]
log_file =
iscsi_proxies=nfsserv11
mgt_user_name=root
mgt_user_private_key=/some/dir/key.rsa

# To use LVM on the local machine as the pdisk backend, use 'local' as the section name.
# In other cases, SSH will be used to connect to backend and user/key must be defined
[nfsserv11]
# iSCSI back-end type (case insensitive)
type=LVM
# LVM volume group to use
volume_name = /dev/nfs.02

------------------------------------------

+ Authentication +
++++++++++++++++++

The script uses ssh to connect to the NetApp filer. Before being able
to successfully use it, SSH keys must be properly configured for the
account used by StratusLab pdisk and appropriate parameters
(mgt_user_name/mgt_user_private_key) must be defined in the
configuration file.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

LUN cloning, as implemented by pdisk snapshot action, involves the creation
of a volume snapshot backing the LUN clone. This volume snapshot must contain
the original LUN. StratusLab creates a volume snapshot for each original LUN
the first time it is cloned. This volume snapshot will be share by all clones of
the original LUN. An attempt to delete the volume snapshot will be made when
the original LUN is deleted: it will succeed only if the LUN clones have been
deleted before. In the other cases, if may be necessary to clean the unused
volume snapshots manually. NetApp command 'snap list' allows to list the existing
snapshots and to show if they are busy.

By default, when a volume snapshot is created, it becomes a dependendy of all the
previously created snapshots of the same volume. As a result, it is not possible
to delete a volume snapshot before all the LUN clones (whatever the original LUN is) and
all the volume snapshots created after its creation have been deleted. As a result,
the hard limit of 255 snapshots per volume may be quickly reached. To avoid this,
it is necessary to set the volume option (command 'volume options')
'snapshot_clone_dependency' to 'on' (it is 'off' by default). The side effect of this 
setting is that an attempt to restore a LUN with 'snap restore' may fail. This
should not be a problem for LUNs managed by StratusLab pdisk as this feature is
neither used nor exposed.
