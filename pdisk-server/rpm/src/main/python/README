This module adds support for NetApp filers as a pdisk storage backend.

Support is implemented through the script
scripts/persistent-disk-netapp.py. This script handles all pdisk
operations (create, delete, rebase, snapshot). The action to execute
is selected with option --action. Use option --help to get the full
list of supported options.

In addition to options, the script requires up to 2 arguments
- LUN GUID : this argument is required for all actions
- LUN size : required only for create action (ignored by others)

+ Configuration +
+++++++++++++++++

This script requires a configuration file to describe which filers are
available, how to connect them, where to create new LUNs...  The
default config file is
/opt/stratuslab/etc/persistent-disk-backend.conf. This location can be
modified with option --config.  This script is divided into sections
introduced by '[section_name]'. Section [main] is required and must
list the available iSCSI proxies (servers) in iscsi_proxies
attribute. For each iSCSI proxy, a section is required whose name must
be the proxy name. This section lists parameters specific to the iSCSI
proxy.

A typical configuration file looks like:
------------------------------------------
[main]
log_file =
iscsi_proxies=nfsserv21,nfsserv22
mgt_user_name=root
mgt_user_private_key=/some/dir/key.rsa

# First filer
[nfsserv21]
# iSCSI proxy type (case insensitive, currently only NetApp is supported and this is the default)
type=NetApp
# Initiator group the LUN must be mapped to
initiator_group = linux_servers
# Name appended to the volume name to build the LUN path (a / will be appended)
lun_namespace=stratuslab
# Volume name where LUNs will be created
volume_name = /vol/iscsi
# Name prefix to use to build the volume snapshot used as a LUN clone snapshot parent
# (a _ will be appended)
volume_snapshot_prefix=pdisk_clone

# Second filer : values can be identical or different to previous server
# depending on site actual configuration choices
[nfsserv22]
# iSCSI proxy type (case insensitive, currently only NetApp is supported and this is the default)
type=NetApp
# Initiator group the LUN must be mapped to
initiator_group = linux_servers
# Name appended to the volume name to build the LUN path (a / will be appended)
lun_namespace=stratuslab
# Volume name where LUNs will be created
volume_name = /vol/iscsi2
# Name prefix to use to build the volume snapshot used as a LUN clone snapshot parent
# (a _ will be appended)
volume_snapshot_prefix=pdisk_clone
------------------------------------------

+ Authentication +
++++++++++++++++++

The script uses ssh to connect to the NetApp filer. Before being able
to successfully use it, SSH keys must be properly configured for the
account used by StratusLab pdisk and appropriate parameters
(mgt_user_name/mgt_user_private_key) must be defined in the
configuration file.
