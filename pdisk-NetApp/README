This module adds support for NetApp filers as a pdisk storage backend.

Support is implemented through the script scripts/persistent-disk-management.py. This script handles all pdisk 
operations (create, delete, rebase, snapshot). The action to execute is selected with option --action. Use option --help to
get the full list of supported options.

In addition to options, the script requires up to 2 arguments
- LUN GUID : this argument is required for all actions
- LUN size : required only for create action (ignored by others)

+ Configuration +
+++++++++++++++++

This script requires a configuration file to describe which filers are available, how to connect them, where to create new LUNs...
The default config file is /opt/stratuslab/etc/persistent-disk-backend.conf. This location can be modified with option --config.
This script is devided into sections introduced by '[section_name]'. Section [main] is required and must list the available iSCSI
proxies (servers) in iscsi_proxies attribute. For each iSCSI proxy, a section is required whose name must be the proxy name. This
section lists parameters specific to the iSCSI proxy.

A typical configuration file looks like:
------------------------------------------
[main]
log_file =
iscsi_proxies=nfsserv21,nfsserv22
mgt_user_name=root
mgt_user_private_key=/some/dir/key.rsa

[nfsserv21]
lun_namespace = /iscsi/stratuslab
initiator_group = linux_servers

[nfsserv22]
lun_namespace = /iscsi/stratuslab
initiator_group = linux_servers
------------------------------------------

+ Authentication +
++++++++++++++++++

The script uses ssh to connect to the NetApp filer. Before being able to
successfully use it, SSH keys must be properly configured for the
account used by StratusLab pdisk and appropriate parameters (mgt_user_name/mgt_user_private_key)
must be defined in the configuration file.
